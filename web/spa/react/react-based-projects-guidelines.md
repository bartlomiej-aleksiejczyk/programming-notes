# Preface

## My goal

My main goal is to expand my knowledge and understanding of React-based SPA (Single Page Application) projects. I want to compile all the knowledge I acquire here.

## About these guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to help write commercial-grade applications in React. The main emphasis is on the architectural perspective: how to design complex forms or text editors, how to break them down into components, how to divide responsibilities, and how to name things. These guidelines will discuss various approaches to accomplishing certain tasks. This guide focuses on Single Page Applications and will not cover backend-for-frontend based metaframeworks such as Next.js or Remix.

## Current stage of this text

At this moment, the guidelines are in an early VIP state, so information may be incomplete.
