# About

This repository contains my programming notes.

# How notes are structured

Notes are divided firstly by area of programming, e.g., Web development, Embedded development, and Game development. Next, notes are divided by the pattern or type they use, for example, SPA or backend-for-frontend. Lastly, notes are divided by technology.
